## Summary of use

The minesweeper_js repository is used in Kubercade as a Minesweeper-like game. The original repository's code was imported into the `vendor` directory and run as static files.

The original source code was not modified in order to integrate with the Kubercade high scores functionality. Instead, the `winGame` function from `main.js` is patched upon game load.
